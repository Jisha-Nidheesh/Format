The Red Fort also known as LalQila is a 17th century fort
constructed by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan
city of Delhi, India
that served as the residence of the Mughal Emperors.
The fort was the palace for Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan's new capital,
Shahjahanabad, the seventh city in the Delhi site.
He moved his capital here from Agra in a move designed to bring prestige to his reign.
</p>
  <p>
It served as the capital of the Mughals until 1857,
when Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar was exiled by the British Indian Government.
</p>
<p>
The Red Fort derives its name from the extensive use of red sandstone
on the massive walls that surround the fort.

Every year on 15 August, the Independence day of India from the British,
Prime Minister hoists the national flag at the Red Fort,
followed by a nationally broadcast speech.

The Red Fort is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Old Delhi,
attracting thousands of visitors every year. Today,
a sound and light show describing Mughal history is a tourist attraction in the evenings.

It also happens to be the largest monument in Old Delhi.
